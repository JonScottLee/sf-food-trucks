✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Rationale

Nx is a great tool for manging monorepos, and any decently-complex frontend app will benefit from being a monorepo (in my humble opinion). A monorepo is a good way to help enforce package boundaries -- for example, an app's UI components can go in their own package, to emphasize that they are standalone, param-driven components. Data fetching can live in the app itself, not in the UI repo. You can have a backend project for munging / sanitizing / whatever, rather than do it in the browser. You can create a project just for your e2e tests, which absolutely need to be isolated from the actual components, if you're writing e2e tests properly. And so on.

For this app, much of this benefit is going under-utilized, for the time being. But future expansion will be much easier with this structure in place.

## Development server

Run `npx nx serve frontend` or `npx nx run frontend:serve` for a dev server on localhost:4200.

## Data Concerns

This repo uses NextJS's "api routes" functionality to handle fetching data. For a simple project like this, that suffices. At some point, an app might reach a level of complexity where one would generate a 'backend' project, which could be deployed separately, given appropriate resources in k8s, handle complex caching concerns, etc. Outside the scope of this project, though.

## Architecture

See Git commit history for specific info re: decisions... but the high-level is that this is a NextJS app, because NextJS handles a lot of obvious concerns out of the box, especially routing, and SSG vs. SSR vs.

This app uses Nx to enforce separation of concerns, and provide future extensibility, especially for handling more robust data-fetching needs, as mentioned in previous section. Setting that aside, Nx provides some great CLI file generation abilities, and a very logical way to separate component libs from frontend apps. And it's build tools are very easy to use to boot.

## Notes

Not all pages in this app have unit tests written, as I feel that writing the tests for the most complex page is enough of a demonstration. In that vein, this app also has no e2e tests written, though I did choose to set up the project, albeit it uses a Cypress boilerplate, and I prefer Playwright. Future enhancement.
