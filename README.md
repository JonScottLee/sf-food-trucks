## Rationale

Nx is a great tool for manging monorepos, and any decently-complex frontend app will benefit from being a monorepo (in my humble opinion). A monorepo is a good way to help enforce package boundaries -- for example, an app's UI components can go in their own package, to emphasize that they are standalone, param-driven components. Data fetching can live in the app itself, not in the UI repo. You can have a backend project for munging / sanitizing / whatever, rather than do it in the browser. And so on.

For this app, much of this benefit is going under-utilized, for the time being. But future expansion will be much easier with this structure in place.

## Development server

Run `npx nx serve frontend` or `npx nx run frontend:serve` for a dev server on localhost:4200.
